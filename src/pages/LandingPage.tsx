                  Plogging-Ethiopia traces its origins back to a family excursion that spanned more than five years
                  before officially launching in January 2021 at Entoto Park, Addis Ababa. The individuals behind this
                  initiative are Firew Kefyalew, a father, and his three sons â€“ Yeab, Lihiq, and Amnen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plogging-Ethiopia goes beyond simply collecting trash; it represents a dynamic movement that combines
                  physical fitness, community involvement, and environmental responsibility. The concept, originating
                  from Sweden, quickly gained momentum as Firew and a growing community of volunteers realized its
                  potential to make a meaningful impact in Ethiopia. Our dedicated volunteers, comprising students and
                  professionals alike, unite under a shared objective: fostering a healthier Ethiopia by tackling
                  plastic pollution and advocating for an active way of life.

                <p>
                  Plogging is more than an exercise routine; it's a revolutionary approach to environmental stewardship.
                  Participants jog or walk, intermittently stopping to pick up litter along their route. This simple yet
                  powerful activity not only promotes physical fitness but also raises awareness about the impact of
                  plastic pollution on our communities and environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The beauty of plogging lies in its accessibility and immediate impact. Whether you're a seasoned
                  runner or prefer a leisurely walk, plogging adapts to your fitness level while contributing to a
                  cleaner, healthier environment for everyone.

                  Plogging Ethiopia's remarkable achievements have gained both national and international recognition.
                  Since our inception, we have organized numerous events, contributed to Ethiopia's Prime Minister for
                  their exceptional community service. Despite starting from humble beginnings without an official
                  office, our impact has been profound. We have successfully organized events that have attracted
                  hundreds of participants, collected tons of waste, and raised collective action and the positive
                  energy that drives social change. Our movement has become a symbol of grassroots environmental
                  activism in Ethiopia, inspiring similar initiatives across the country.
